<p>A thread is defined as the execution path of a program. Each thread defines a unique flow of control. If your application involves complicated and time consuming operations such as database access or some intense I/O operations, then it is often helpful to set different execution paths or threads, with each thread performing a particular job.</p>
<p>Threads are lightweight processes. One common example of use of thread is implementation of concurrent programming by modern operating systems. Use of threads saves wastage of CPU cycle and increases efficiency of an application.</p>
<p>So far we compiled programs where a single thread runs as a single process which is the running instance of the application. However, this way the application can perform one job at a time. To make it execute multiple tasks at a time, it could be divided into smaller threads.</p>
<p>In .Net, the threading is handled through the 'System.Threading' namespace. Creating a variable of the&nbsp;<em>System.Threading.Thread</em>&nbsp;type allows you to create a new thread to start working with. It allows you to create and access individual threads in a program.</p>
<h2>Creating Thread</h2>
<p>A thread is created by creating a Thread object, giving its constructor a ThreadStart reference.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted"><span class="typ">ThreadStart</span><span class="pln"> childthreat </span><span class="pun">=</span> <span class="kwd">new</span> <span class="typ">ThreadStart</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">childthreadcall</span><span class="pun">);</span></pre>
<h2>Thread Life Cycle</h2>
<p>The life cycle of a thread starts when an object of the System.Threading.Thread class is created and ends when the thread is terminated or completes execution.</p>
<p>Following are the various states in the life cycle of a thread:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>The Unstarted State</strong>&nbsp;: It is the situation when the instance of the thread is created but the Start method is not called.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Ready State</strong>&nbsp;: It is the situation when the thread is ready to execute and waiting CPU cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Not Runnable State</strong>&nbsp;: a thread is not runnable, when:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Sleep method has been called</li>
<li>Wait method has been called</li>
<li>Blocked by I/O operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Dead State</strong>&nbsp;: It is the situation when the thread has completed execution or has been aborted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thread Priority</h2>
<p>The Priority property of the Thread class specifies the priority of one thread with respect to other. The .Net runtime selects the ready thread with the highest priority.</p>
<p>The priorities could be categorized as:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Above normal</li>
<li>Below normal</li>
<li>Highest</li>
<li>Lowest</li>
<li>Normal</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a thread is created, its priority is set using the Priority property of the thread class.</p>

<p>The Thread class has the following important methods:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Methods</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Abort</td>
<td>Raises a ThreadAbortException in the thread on which it is invoked, to begin the process of terminating the thread. Calling this method usually terminates the thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AllocateDataSlot</td>
<td>Allocates an unnamed data slot on all the threads. For better performance, use fields that are marked with the ThreadStaticAttribute attribute instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AllocateNamedDataSlot</td>
<td>Allocates a named data slot on all threads. For better performance, use fields that are marked with the ThreadStaticAttribute attribute instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BeginCriticalRegion</td>
<td>Notifies a host that execution is about to enter a region of code in which the effects of a thread abort or unhandled exception might endanger other tasks in the application domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BeginThreadAffinity</td>
<td>Notifies a host that managed code is about to execute instructions that depend on the identity of the current physical operating system thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EndCriticalRegion</td>
<td>Notifies a host that execution is about to enter a region of code in which the effects of a thread abort or unhandled exception are limited to the current task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EndThreadAffinity</td>
<td>Notifies a host that managed code has finished executing instructions that depend on the identity of the current physical operating system thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FreeNamedDataSlot</td>
<td>Eliminates the association between a name and a slot, for all threads in the process. For better performance, use fields that are marked with the ThreadStaticAttribute attribute instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GetData</td>
<td>Retrieves the value from the specified slot on the current thread, within the current thread's current domain. For better performance, use fields that are marked with the ThreadStaticAttribute attribute instead.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>GetDomainID</td>
<td>Returns a unique application domain identifier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Join</td>
<td>Blocks the calling thread until a thread terminates, while continuing to perform standard COM and SendMessage pumping. This method has different overloaded forms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MemoryBarrier</td>
<td>Synchronizes memory access as follows: The processor executing the current thread cannot reorder instructions in such a way that memory accesses prior to the call to MemoryBarrier execute after memory accesses that follow the call to MemoryBarrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ResetAbort</td>
<td>Cancels an Abort requested for the current thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SetData</td>
<td>Sets the data in the specified slot on the currently running thread, for that thread's current domain. For better performance, use fields marked with the ThreadStaticAttribute attribute instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>SpinWait</td>
