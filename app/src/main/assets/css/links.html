This chapter teaches you how to set different properties of a hyper link using CSS. You can set following properties of a hyper link −

We will revisit the same properties when we will discuss Pseudo-Classes of CSS.

The :link signifies unvisited hyperlinks.

The :visited signifies visited hyperlinks.

The :hover signifies an element that currently has the user's mouse pointer hovering over it.

The :active signifies an element on which the user is currently clicking.

Usually, all these properties are kept in the header part of the HTML document.

Remember a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective. Also, a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition as follows −

<style type = "text/css">
   a:link {color: #000000}
   a:visited {color: #006600}
   a:hover {color: #FFCC00}
   a:active {color: #FF00CC}
</style>
Now, we will see how to use these properties to give different effects to hyperlinks.
