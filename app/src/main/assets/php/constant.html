<p>A constant is a name or an identifier for a simple value. A constant value cannot change during the execution of the script. By default, a constant is case-sensitive. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase. A constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. If you have defined a constant, it can never be changed or undefined.</p>
<p>To define a constant you have to use define() function and to retrieve the value of a constant, you have to simply specifying its name. Unlike with variables, you do not need to have a constant with a $. You can also use the function constant() to read a constant's value if you wish to obtain the constant's name dynamically.</p>
<h2>constant() function</h2>
<p>As indicated by the name, this function will return the value of the constant.</p>
<p>This is useful when you want to retrieve value of a constant, but you do not know its name, i.e. It is stored in a variable or returned by a function.</p>
<h2>constant() example</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted"><span class="pun">&lt;?</span><span class="pln">php
   define</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"MINSIZE"</span><span class="pun">,</span> <span class="lit">50</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
   
   echo MINSIZE</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
   echo constant</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"MINSIZE"</span><span class="pun">);</span> <span class="com">// same thing as the previous line</span>
<span class="pun">?&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Only scalar data (boolean, integer, float and string) can be contained in constants.</p>
<h2>Differences between constants and variables are</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>There is no need to write a dollar sign ($) before a constant, where as in Variable one has to write a dollar sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constants cannot be defined by simple assignment, they may only be defined using the define() function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constants may be defined and accessed anywhere without regard to variable scoping rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the Constants have been set, may not be redefined or undefined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Valid and invalid constant names</h2>
<pre class="result notranslate">// Valid constant names
define("ONE",     "first thing");
define("TWO2",    "second thing");
define("THREE_3", "third thing");

// Invalid constant names
define("2TWO",    "second thing");
define("__THREE__", "third value"); 
</pre>
<h2>PHP Magic constants</h2>
<p>PHP provides a large number of predefined constants to any script which it runs.</p>
<p>There are five magical constants that change depending on where they are used. For example, the value of __LINE__ depends on the line that it's used on in your script. These special constants are case-insensitive and are as follows &minus;</p>
<p>A few "magical" PHP constants are given below &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Sr.No</th>
<th>Name &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><strong>__LINE__</strong></p>
<p>The current line number of the file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><strong>__FILE__</strong></p>
<p>The full path and filename of the file. If used inside an include,the name of the included file is returned. Since PHP 4.0.2,&nbsp;<strong>__FILE__</strong>&nbsp;always contains an absolute path whereas in older versions it contained relative path under some circumstances.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><strong>__FUNCTION__</strong></p>
<p>The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td>
<p><strong>__CLASS__</strong></p>
<p>The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the class name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><strong>__METHOD__</strong></p>
<p>The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0) The method name is returned as it was declared (case-sensitive).</p>
