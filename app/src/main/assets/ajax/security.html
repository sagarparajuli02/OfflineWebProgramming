<h2>AJAX Security: Server Side</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>AJAX-based Web applications use the same server-side security schemes of regular Web applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You specify authentication, authorization, and data protection requirements in your web.xml file (declarative) or in your program (programmatic).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AJAX-based Web applications are subject to the same security threats as regular Web applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>AJAX Security: Client Side</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>JavaScript code is visible to a user/hacker. Hacker can use JavaScript code for inferring server-side weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript code is downloaded from the server and executed ("eval") at the client and can compromise the client by mal-intended code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Downloaded JavaScript code is constrained by the sand-box security model and can be relaxed for signed JavaScript.</p>
</li>
</ul>
