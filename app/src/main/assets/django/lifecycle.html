<p>A project is a sum of many applications. Every application has an objective and can be reused into another project, like the contact form on a website can be an application, and can be reused for others. See it as a module of your project.</p>
<h2>Create an Application</h2>
<p>We assume you are in your project folder. In our main &ldquo;myproject&rdquo; folder, the same folder then manage.py &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">$ python manage.py startapp myapp
</pre>
<p>You just created myapp application and like project, Django create a &ldquo;myapp&rdquo; folder with the application structure &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">myapp/
   __init__.py
   admin.py
   models.py
   tests.py
   views.py
</pre>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>__init__.py</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Just to make sure python handles this folder as a package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>admin.py</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This file helps you make the app modifiable in the admin interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>models.py</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is where all the application models are stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tests.py</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is where your unit tests are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>views.py</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is where your application views are.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get the Project to Know About Your Application</h2>
<p>At this stage we have our "myapp" application, now we need to register it with our Django project "myproject". To do so, update INSTALLED_APPS tuple in the settings.py file of your project (add your app name) &minus;</p>
