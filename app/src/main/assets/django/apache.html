<p>So far, in our examples, we have used the Django dev web server. But this server is just for testing and is not fit for production environment. Once in production, you need a real server like Apache, Nginx, etc. Let's discuss Apache in this chapter.</p>
<p>Serving Django applications via Apache is done by using mod_wsgi. So the first thing is to make sure you have Apache and mod_wsgi installed. Remember, when we created our project and we looked at the project structure, it looked like &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">myproject/
   manage.py
   myproject/
      __init__.py
      settings.py
      urls.py
      wsgi.py
</pre>
<p>The wsgi.py file is the one taking care of the link between Django and Apache.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to share our project (myproject) with Apache. We just need to set Apache to access our folder. Assume we put our myproject folder in the default "/var/www/html". At this stage, accessing the project will be done via 127.0.0.1/myproject. This will result in Apache just listing the folder as shown in the following snapshot.</p>

<p>As seen, Apache is not handling Django stuff. For this to be taken care of, we need to configure Apache in httpd.conf. So open the httpd.conf and add the following line &minus;</p>

<p>If you can access the login page as 127.0.0.1/myapp/connection, you will get to see the following page &minus;</p>
